Thanks for taking the time to provide corrections and additions!

To add an example with a new framework please follow the structure used for the other examples:
* Check the `example-<testlib>` folders and create a similar folder for the new library to showcase its capabilities.
* Add a new column to the main [readme.md](https://github.com/dodie/testing-in-bash/blob/master/readme.md) file for the new library.
  * To keep sanity while editing the huge table I disable line wrapping and use a [markdown formatter](http://markdowntable.com/).
